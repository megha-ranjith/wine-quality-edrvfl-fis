# 🍷 Wine Quality Classification with edRVFL-FIS

Predicts wine quality from laboratory chemical features using advanced AI: an **Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Neural Network based on Fuzzy Inference System** (edRVFL-FIS).

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project predicts wine quality (good/bad) by combining fuzzy logic with deep ensemble learning. The approach uses fuzzy inference to enrich classical physicochemical features, and an ensemble of deep random vector functional link networks to perform the classification. All code is in Python, and full training/testing/visualization is automated.

## 💡 Methodology

- **Dataset**: [UCI Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Features**: 11 chemical measurements per wine; target = human-rated quality.
- **Binary Classification**: Quality ≤5 → low; >5 → high.
- **Fuzzy Rule Creation**: K-Means clustering generates 15 fuzzy "typical patterns."
- **Fuzzification/Defuzzification**: Each wine's features are converted into fuzzy memberships and recombined into richer features.
- **Deep Ensemble Learning**: Five stacked edRVFL base models; each layer uses classical + fuzzy features; voting yields the final prediction.
